# Code Quiz Challenge

## Description

In this project, I created a simple code quiz using HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery. More features will be added as this project is updated such as instant feedback, score calculation, and data storage. 

## Getting Started

The users will see the start screen (information on how the quiz works), and when they click on Start, they should be able to see each question. When they click on any button, the other questions are rendered one by one. 

First, the users are provided with a prompt and asked to determine the length of their secure password. Once they enter this information in numeric value, they will need to confirm other criteria for their secure password.

Then, users are asked to confirm whether they want symbols, strings, and/or numbers in their passwords. For each criteria they confirm, the password will include those items as well.

Finally, a secure password is generated with user-determined criteria.

### Cloning the CSS/HTML files from Repository

* Please go to https://github.com/begumsacak/code-quiz-challenge to download the raw code files from the Github repository. 
* Clone the HTTPS to your Terminal to download the raw files of HTML, CSS, and Javascript along with a sample quiz layout (gif file), which was the initial model layout I tried to follow when I created the quiz.
