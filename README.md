# Code Quiz Challenge

## Description

In this project, I created a simple code quiz using HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery. More features will be added as this project is updated such as instant feedback, score calculation, and data storage. 

## Getting Started

The users will see the start screen (information on how the quiz works), and when they click on Start, they should be able to see each question. When they click on any button, the other questions are rendered one by one. 

### Cloning the CSS/HTML files from Repository

* Please go to https://github.com/begumsacak/code-quiz-challenge to download the raw code files from the Github repository. 
* Clone the HTTPS to your Terminal to download the raw files of HTML, CSS, and Javascript along with a sample quiz layout (gif file), which was the initial model layout I tried to follow when I created the quiz.
